Task Solutions Repository - C

Welcome to my Task Solutions Repository! This repository contains solutions to various C programming exercises and tasks that I have worked on. These solutions cover a wide range of topics and problems, helping me strengthen my C programming skills through practical problem-solving.

Purpose

This repository serves as a personal collection of C code solutions to exercises and tasks. It allows me to track my progress and share my approaches to solving different challenges in C. You are welcome to explore, learn, and adapt the solutions for your own projects.

Structure

Each file represents a specific task or exercise. The code is well-organized and contains comments to help explain key parts of the solution. The repository is structured to ensure that each task is easy to navigate and understand.

Technologies Used

- C Programming Language: The primary language used for all exercises.
- Standard libraries such as stdio.h, stdlib.h, etc., are used where necessary.

How to Use

- Clone this repository to your local machine to access and run the C code.
- Each task is contained in its own file. You can compile and execute the solutions using a C compiler (like GCC).

  Example to compile and run:
  gcc task1.c -o task1
  ./task1

- Review the comments in the code for explanations of logic and steps.
